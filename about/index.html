	<h1>About Me</h1><br>

	<p>My name is Steven Pemberton. I'm a software developer by trade based in the UK. <br> 
	Like most of us, I spend a lot of my spare time coding, either on my own personal projects or contributing to the open source community.<br><br>
	I blog about anything I find interesting while I go about doing what I enjoy; Developing software and exploring new technology.<br>
	This includes code, language features, the web, frameworks, projects and pretty much anything else I think others may be interested in.</p><br><br>


	<p> I hope you find my musings entertaining and/or helpful (preferably both!).<br>
	Personally, the posts I create here also help in bolstering my own knowledge and understanding. I therefore greatly appreciate any feedback given, no matter how small. I am always looking for people to learn from.<br>
	So, if you would like to provide feedback, ask a question, or simply get in touch, please feel free. <a style="color:#028fcc;" href="/contact">Get in touch.</a> </p>  <br><br>

	<p>P.S. If you find anything wrong with the site, please let me know. Or better yet, open a pull request on GitHub.</p><br>

	<p><b>Thanks for visiting!</b></p>
